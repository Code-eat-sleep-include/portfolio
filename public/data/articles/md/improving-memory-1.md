## Why Active Recall

Active recall is more effective than passively reading or recognizing information. It strengthens neural pathways associated with the information, which helps store memories longer.

Active recall can:

- Improve memory retention
- Reduce cognitive load
- Make learning sessions more efficient
- Help commit information to long-term memory
- Enhance long-term memory

## How to Use Active Recall

The most common way to use active recall is to create flashcards. Flashcards are a great way to test your knowledge and recall information. They can be used to study any subject, including math, science, history, and language.

However, me personally, I don't like flashcards. I prefer linking information together (I will talk about this in a future article), basically, I go through my notes or articles once, reading the text thoroughly, and then I try to recall the information in the same order as I read it. If I can't recall something, I go back to the article and read it again. I repeat this process until I can recall everything. I find this method more effective than flashcards as our brain is not designed to remember isolated facts, but rather to remember things in context.

Active recall when combined with spaced repetition is even more effective. Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals. It helps you remember information for longer periods of time and reduces the amount of time spent studying.

## Conclusion

Active recall is a powerful learning technique that can help you learn and remember information more effectively. It's easy to use and can be applied to any subject. If you're looking for a way to improve your memory, try using active recall today!
